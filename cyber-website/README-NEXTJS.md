# BizBit Solutions - Next.js Implementation

This is the Next.js implementation of the BizBit Solutions website with dynamic services pages and client-side search functionality.

## ðŸš€ Phase 2 Task 1 - Dynamic Services Pages

### Features Implemented

- âœ… **Dynamic Services Pages**: All services are now generated from `data/services.json`
- âœ… **Client-Side Search**: Powered by Fuse.js for fuzzy search functionality
- âœ… **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Using `getStaticProps()` and `getStaticPaths()`
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Consistent layout with sidebar and WhatsApp button
- âœ… **SEO Optimized**: Proper meta tags and structured data

### Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Layout.js          # Main layout with sidebar and WhatsApp button
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ServiceCard.js     # Service card component for listings

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ contact.js         # Contact page
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ _app.js            # Next.js app configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/            # Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
â””â”€â”€ package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
```

### Services Data Structure

Each service in `data/services.json` includes:
- `slug`: URL-friendly identifier
- `title`: Service name
- `category`: Service category (8 total categories)
- `price`: Pricing in KSH
- `currency`: Currency (KSH)
- `summary`: Brief description
- `description`: Detailed description
- `features`: Array of service features
- `deliveryTime`: Estimated delivery time
- `support`: Support duration
- `warranty`: Warranty period

### Search Functionality

The search component (`SearchInput.js`) provides:
- **Text Search**: Searches across title, summary, category, and features
- **Category Filter**: Filter by service category
- **Fuzzy Search**: Powered by Fuse.js for intelligent matching
- **Real-time Results**: Instant filtering without server requests
- **Clear Filters**: Easy reset functionality

### Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Export Static Site**
   ```bash
   npm run export
   ```

### Key Routes

- `/` - Homepage with hero section and service overview
- `/services` - Services listing with search and filters
- `/services/[slug]` - Individual service detail pages
- `/about` - About page
- `/contact` - Contact page

### Technical Implementation

#### Static Site Generation (SSG)

**Services Index Page** (`/pages/services/index.js`):
- Uses `getStaticProps()` to read `data/services.json` at build time
- Generates static HTML with all services data
- Client-side search filters the pre-loaded data

**Service Detail Pages** (`/pages/services/[slug].js`):
- Uses `getStaticPaths()` to generate paths for all services
- Uses `getStaticProps()` to load individual service data
- Includes related services from the same category

#### Search Implementation

The search functionality is entirely client-side:
1. All services data is loaded at build time
2. Fuse.js provides fuzzy search capabilities
3. React state manages filtered results
4. No additional API calls required

#### Layout Consistency

All pages use the `Layout` component which includes:
- Consistent sidebar navigation
- WhatsApp floating button
- Proper meta tags and SEO
- Mobile-responsive design

### Performance Features

- **Static Generation**: All pages pre-built at compile time
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js automatic image optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for optimal loading
- **CSS Optimization**: Tailwind CSS with purging for minimal bundle size

### SEO Features

- **Dynamic Meta Tags**: Each service page has unique title and description
- **Structured Data**: JSON-LD for better search engine understanding
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading structure and ARIA labels
- **Open Graph**: Social media sharing optimization

### Deployment

The project is configured for Vercel deployment with:
- `next.config.js` optimized for static export
- `vercel.json` configuration (if needed)
- Automatic builds on git push

### Testing Locally

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
3. Test the following:
   - Homepage loads with hero section
   - Services page shows all 32 services
   - Search functionality works
   - Individual service pages load correctly
   - Sidebar navigation works on all pages
   - WhatsApp button appears on all pages
   - Mobile responsiveness
